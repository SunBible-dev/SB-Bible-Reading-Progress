## Hi

My name is N.C.R. I am the founder of The SunShining.
I also am the creator and developer of SunBible.

SunBible is...

A simply beautiful place to read, study, and memorize the Bible.

It also **IS** available as a desktop app.

Anyways I love sharing the Bible in different formats.
And I love to help people get into the word of God.

So I decided to create a Bible reading progress chart.

## About this project:

I first created this in Markdown.
But I wanted something more.

I tried to create it with apples' pages, but I didn't like it.
So I left it unfinished.

I wanted to create a beautiful printable pdf, but I couldn't find any program to create it.
So I created an HTML page then converted it to HTML.

Now that I have HTML I want to turn it into an interactive page and maybe even a chrome extension. (And put my skills to the test)

So that is where I am at as of Feb 24, 2021!
